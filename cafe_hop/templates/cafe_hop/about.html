<div id = 'about-font'>Cafe-hop solves the problem of figuring out what cafes are free so you can spend the most time studying.

<br>
<br>
<br>


If you are at a cafe, please, tell us how full you think the cafe is.

If you are interested in studying at a cafe, you can see a progress bar that tells you how full the cafe is. The percentage bar is calculated using a weighted moving average of ratings from the last 20 minutes. You can also click on the cafe to see comments to get some less quantitative info.</div>
